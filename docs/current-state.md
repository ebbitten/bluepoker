### What's Working

**Development Server:**
- Next.js 15 with React 19 running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Turbopack enabled for fast development
- Landing page displays "Hello Poker" with subtitle

**Available Commands:**
```bash
pnpm dev           # Start development server with Turbopack
pnpm test          # Run Vitest tests
pnpm test:ui       # Open Vitest UI
pnpm lint          # Run ESLint across all packages
pnpm typecheck     # Run TypeScript checks
pnpm build         # Build Next.js application for production
```

└── utils/         # Test utilities
```

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- ✅ TDD workflow established (Spec → Test → Code)
- ✅ Test directory structure with unit/integration/e2e separation
- ✅ Specification templates for documenting features
- ✅ Test utilities and helper functions
- ✅ Example tests for next increment (Card & Deck API)
- ✅ Continuous regression testing workflow

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ ESLint with TypeScript and security rules
- ✅ TypeScript strict type checking
- ✅ Vitest testing framework
- ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks (lint, typecheck, test)
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- ✅ Prettier code formatting

### What You Can See

### Next Steps

Ready to begin **Increment 4 - Table UI and Real-time Updates**:

**Target Features:**
- Minimal table UI showing game state
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling
- Visual representation of cards, chips, and actions
- Player interaction buttons

### Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 20+ (use nvm for version management)
- pnpm 8+ package manager
- Git

**Initial Setup:**
1. **Install Node 20:**
   ```bash
   # If using nvm (recommended)
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   # Or use the .nvmrc file
   nvm use
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev  # Starts Next.js on http://localhost:3000
   ```

**Available Commands:**
```bash
pnpm dev           # Start development server
pnpm build         # Build for production
pnpm test          # Run tests
pnpm test:ui       # Open Vitest UI
pnpm lint          # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck     # Run TypeScript checks
```

**Environment Recreation:**
- All dependencies are locked in `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Node version specified in `.nvmrc`
- Build artifacts are git-ignored and will be regenerated
- No manual setup steps required beyond installing dependencies

**Technical Notes:**
- **Turbopack:** Experimental.turbo config deprecated, should move to config.turbopack
- **Node Warnings:** pnpm may show Node version warnings - functionality works correctly
