## ‚ùå FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (Always Trigger Prompts)

### Command Substitution
```bash
# NEVER USE:
$(command)
`command`
VAR=$(command)
```

### Pipe Operations

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

### For Core Game Testing
```bash
# Create and test a complete game flow
./scripts/api-test.sh create_game "Alice" "Bob"
# Use the returned game ID in subsequent commands
./scripts/api-test.sh deal "your-game-id-here"
./scripts/api-test.sh get_game "your-game-id-here"
# Extract player ID from game state, then:
./scripts/api-test.sh player_action "game-id" "player-id" call
```

### For Development Workflow
```bash
# Standard development cycle
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

### For Production Validation
```bash
# Full system validation (accept 2 permission prompts)
./scripts/test-all-comprehensive.sh
```
