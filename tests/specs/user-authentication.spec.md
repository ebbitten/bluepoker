# User Authentication System Specification

## Purpose
Implement user accounts, login/registration, and session management to ensure only authenticated users can control their own game actions.

## API Contract

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register
  Body: { username: string, email: string, password: string }
  Returns: { success: boolean, user: User, token: string, error?: string }

POST /api/auth/login  
  Body: { email: string, password: string }
  Returns: { success: boolean, user: User, token: string, error?: string }

POST /api/auth/logout
  Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }
  Returns: { success: boolean }

GET /api/auth/me
  Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }
  Returns: { user: User, error?: string }

POST /api/auth/refresh
  Body: { refreshToken: string }
  Returns: { token: string, error?: string }
```

### User Data Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: string;
  lastLoginAt: string;
  stats?: {
    gamesPlayed: number;
    gamesWon: number;
    totalChipsWon: number;
  };
}

interface AuthSession {
  userId: string;
  token: string;
  refreshToken: string;
  expiresAt: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

## Behavior Specifications

### Registration Flow
1. **GIVEN** a new user provides valid registration data
2. **WHEN** they submit the registration form
3. **THEN** a new user account is created
4. **AND** they receive an authentication token
5. **AND** they are automatically logged in

### Login Flow  
1. **GIVEN** an existing user provides correct credentials
2. **WHEN** they submit the login form
3. **THEN** they receive an authentication token
4. **AND** their session is established
5. **AND** they can access protected resources

### Session Protection
1. **GIVEN** a user is not authenticated
2. **WHEN** they try to access protected game actions
3. **THEN** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response
4. **AND** are redirected to login

### Game Action Authorization
1. **GIVEN** a user is authenticated as UserA
2. **WHEN** they try to make an action in a game
3. **THEN** the system verifies UserA is a player in that game
4. **AND** only allows the action if it's UserA's turn
5. **AND** rejects actions for other players

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] User registration with username/email/password
- [x] Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- [x] JWT token-based authentication
- [x] Session management and token refresh
- [x] Protected API endpoints require authentication
- [x] Users can only control their own game actions
- [x] Automatic logout on token expiration
- [x] Login/registration UI components

### Should Have  
- [x] Email validation during registration
- [x] Password strength requirements
- [x] Remember me functionality
- [x] User profile page
- [x] Basic user statistics
- [x] Logout from all devices

### Could Have
- [x] Email verification for new accounts
- [x] Password reset flow
- [x] OAuth integration (Google/GitHub)
- [x] User avatar uploads
- [x] Advanced user statistics

## Integration Points

### Lobby System Changes
- Join game requires authentication
- Player identity comes from authenticated user
- Game ownership by creator user

### Game System Changes  
- All game actions require authentication
- Player actions verified against authenticated user
- Game state includes authenticated user IDs

### UI Changes
- Login/register pages
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- User profile dropdown in navigation
- "Sign out" functionality

## Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests
- Password hashing/verification
- JWT token generation/validation
- User model validation
- Session management logic

### Integration Tests
- Registration API flow
- Login API flow
- Protected endpoint access
- Token refresh mechanism
- Game action authorization

### E2E Tests
- Complete registration → lobby → game flow
- Login → join game → make actions
- Session expiration handling
- Multiple users in same game
- User can only control own actions

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Minimum 8 characters, requires mix of character types
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2, never stored plaintext
- Rate limiting on login attempts

### Token Security
- JWT tokens with reasonable expiration (1 hour)
- Refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication
- Secure httpOnly cookies for token storage
- CSRF protection for auth endpoints

### Session Security
- Token blacklisting on logout
- Session timeout after inactivity
- Secure session storage
- Protection against token theft

## Performance Requirements

- Registration: < 500ms response time
- Login: < 200ms response time  
- Token validation: < 50ms response time
- Concurrent users: Support 1000+ authenticated sessions
- Database queries: Optimized user lookups with indices

## Error Handling

### Registration Errors
- Username already taken
- Email already registered
- Invalid email format
- Password too weak
- Network/database errors

### Login Errors
- Invalid credentials
- Account not found
- Account locked/suspended
- Token generation failure
- Network/database errors

### Session Errors
- Token expired
- Token invalid/malformed
- Token blacklisted
- Refresh token expired
- Session not found

This specification will guide the implementation of a complete user authentication system that integrates seamlessly with the existing poker platform.
