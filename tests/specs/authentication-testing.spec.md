```

### Protected Game Endpoints
```typescript

```

## Behavior Specifications

### User Registration Flow
1. **Valid Registration**
   - GIVEN: Valid email, strong password, unique username
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/register
   - THEN: User created, token returned, user logged in

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - GIVEN: Email or username already exists
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/register
   - THEN: 400 error with descriptive message

3. **Input Validation**
   - GIVEN: Invalid email format
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/register
   - THEN: 400 error with email validation message
   
   - GIVEN: Weak password (< 8 chars, no uppercase, etc.)
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/register
   - THEN: 400 error with password requirements

### Authentication Flow
1. **Valid Login**
   - GIVEN: Registered user with correct credentials
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/login
   - THEN: Token returned, user authenticated

2. **Invalid Credentials**
   - GIVEN: Wrong email or password
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/login
   - THEN: 401 error with generic "invalid credentials" message

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - GIVEN: Multiple failed login attempts
   - WHEN: Exceeding rate limit
   - THEN: 429 error with retry message

### Token Validation
1. **Valid Token Access**
   - GIVEN: Valid JWT token in Authorization header
   - WHEN: GET to /api/auth/me
   - THEN: User profile returned

2. **Invalid Token Rejection**
   - GIVEN: Malformed, expired, or missing token
   - WHEN: GET to /api/auth/me
   - THEN: 401 error with authentication required message

3. **Token Format Handling**
   - GIVEN: Token with/without "Bearer " prefix
   - WHEN: Token validation
   - THEN: Both formats accepted correctly

### Protected Endpoint Security
1. **Unauthenticated Access Rejection**
   - GIVEN: No Authorization header
   - WHEN: Request to protected endpoint
   - THEN: 401 error returned

2. **Game Creation Authorization**
   - GIVEN: Authenticated user
   - WHEN: Creating game with user as player
   - THEN: Game created successfully
   
   - GIVEN: Authenticated user
   - WHEN: Creating game without user as player
   - THEN: 403 error (user must be a player)

3. **Game Action Authorization**
   - GIVEN: Authenticated user in game
   - WHEN: Making action for own player
   - THEN: Action executed successfully
   
   - GIVEN: Authenticated user
   - WHEN: Making action for different player
   - THEN: 403 error (unauthorized action)

### Session Management
1. **Session Persistence**
   - GIVEN: User logged in with valid session
   - WHEN: Page refresh or navigation
   - THEN: User remains authenticated

2. **Logout Process**
   - GIVEN: Authenticated user
   - WHEN: POST to /api/auth/logout
   - THEN: Token invalidated, subsequent requests fail

3. **Token Expiration**
   - GIVEN: Expired JWT token
   - WHEN: Request to protected endpoint
   - THEN: 401 error, user prompted to re-authenticate

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can register with valid credentials
- [ ] User can login with registered credentials
- [ ] User can access protected endpoints with valid token
- [ ] User cannot access protected endpoints without token
- [ ] User can only perform game actions for their own player
- [ ] User session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] User can logout and token becomes invalid

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Passwords are hashed and not stored in plaintext
- [ ] Duplicate usernames/emails are prevented
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected with 401

   - getCurrentUser() with valid/invalid tokens
   - Session management methods

2. **Authentication Middleware Tests**

   - Existing user login → join game → make actions → logout
   - Multi-user game session with real-time synchronization
   - Session persistence across browser refresh

2. **Security Flows**
   - Attempt unauthorized access to protected routes
   - Try to perform actions for other players
   - Token expiration and re-authentication
   - Rate limiting validation

### Load Tests
1. **Authentication Performance**
